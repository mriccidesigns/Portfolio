# Matthew Ricci Portfolio

This is a modern graphic design and 3D artist portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes SEO optimizations, Schema.org structured data, responsive layout, lazy loading for images/videos, and smooth scrolling.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repo.
2. Replace the placeholder images/videos in `assets/images/` and `assets/videos/` with your own media.
3. Update the CNAME file with your custom domain (if you have one).
4. Push the repo to GitHub.
5. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (branch: main, folder: root).

Your portfolio will be live on GitHub Pages or on your custom domain once DNS propagation is complete.
